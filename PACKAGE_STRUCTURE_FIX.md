# Package Structure Fix

## Issue Description

The JUnit tests for the CRUDOperation class were failing with a `ClassNotFoundException`:

```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository.CRUDOperationTest
```

## Root Cause

After investigating the project structure, we found that there was a mismatch between the package declarations in the main code and test code:

1. **Main Code Package Structure**:
   - CRUDOperation.kt: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`
   - DbAnnotation.kt: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.DbRecord`

2. **Test Code Package Structure (before fix)**:
   - CRUDOperationTest.kt: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`
   - TestEntity.kt: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`

The main code had a duplicated base package name (`com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit` appears twice), while the test code had the correct structure without duplication. This mismatch caused the test runner to look for the test class in the wrong package.

## Changes Made

We updated the package declarations in the test files to match the actual package structure of the main code:

1. **CRUDOperationTest.kt**:
   - Changed from: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`
   - To: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`

2. **TestEntity.kt**:
   - Changed from: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`
   - To: `package com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The test runner was looking for the test class in the package `com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`, but the class was actually in `com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.com.cleanbuild.tech.monolit.repository`. By updating the package declarations in the test files, we ensure that the test runner can find the test class in the correct package.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Fix the duplicated package names in the main code**:
   - Consider refactoring the main code to use the correct package structure without duplication.
   - This would make the code more maintainable and avoid confusion.

2. **Ensure consistent package naming**:
   - When creating new classes, make sure to use the correct package structure.
   - Follow the standard Java/Kotlin package naming conventions.

3. **Use package-by-feature instead of package-by-layer**:
   - Consider organizing packages by feature rather than by layer to improve modularity.
   - This can make the codebase more maintainable as it grows.
